And part of me always wanted to be in a creative and technical field, where I can craft something that's never been made before. UX Design is that intersection where my love for helping people meets my passions for creativity and technology.</p><h6 class="animate fade delay-med slide-down">Philosophy</h6><p class="project-p animate fade delay-med slide-down">Design is like creating a present for someone. I spend my time understanding someone’s needs and giving an experience that makes their life better. It’s a rewarding job to design for people. This mindset gives me a caring and attentive approach to my work, where I consider the littlest details of a solution. </p><h6 class="animate fade delay-large slide-down">Activities</h6><p class="project-p animate fade delay-large slide-down">I’m currently working on my Masters in Digital Media and Design.
