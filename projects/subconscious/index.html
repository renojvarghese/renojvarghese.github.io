Their blog articles are contributed by volunteer writers.
The organization noticed a problem where most authors would contribute one article, but never return to write again.
This is the process I took to solve this problem and redesign Subconscious's Contributor Program.</span></p></div><div class="role-container"><label class="role-name">Role: UX Researcher. </label>My job was to investigate how the team could improve the contributor program by interviewing past writers.
I worked with the editor in chief, designer, and operations officer to find insights into how we can improve our program.</div><h2 class="problem">How might we help Subconscious blog writers contribute more often?</h2><h2 class="project-header">Process</h2><div class="project-content"><p class="project-p"><span>The first step was design a user research study to talk to our writers.
We had 5 participants, 3 of whom had written one article and never returned. 
The 2 other writers had written for Subconscious multiple times.
I interviewed writers over the phone and over email/Slack.
I asked the same set of questions to compare their motivations, their writing process, the positive, and the not so positive.</span></p></div><h2 class="project-header">Solution</h2><div class="project-content"><p class="project-p"><span>The final solution was to change the writer program itself.
Here are some of the main insights and implemented changes:</span><ul class="project-list"><li class="project-list-item"><strong>Get to know our contributors from the start: </strong>I made an initial survey to gauge what an individual contributor is looking for.</li><li class="project-list-item"><strong>More communication from the team: </strong>There were a few instances where the Subconscious did not respond to a contributor's questions.
To avoid this, we try to make sure we are the last person to send correspondence. </li><li class="project-list-item"><strong>Specifc feedback on submission: </strong>Many contributors wanted to write because they wanted experience and improve their craft.
We need to go beyond a simple grammar check to provide better professional experience.</li><li class="project-list-item"><strong>Open up submission requirements: </strong>A common strain on the writing process was the word limit. 
Subconscious decided to remove the word limit. If a submission is too long, it can be addressed in the editorial review process.</li><li class="project-list-item"><strong>New opportunities through Subconscious: </strong>To give future professional experience, we can open up roles for editing, interviewing, and journalism.
Artciles can also be art, photography, poetry etc.</li><li class="project-list-item"><strong>Keep track of our own progress: </strong>To keep improving, contributors can take a survey at the end of each submission to rate us on our process.</li><li class="project-list-item"><strong>Follow up with our contributors after submission: </strong>The last point was to reach out after an article is on the site.
It's an opportunity to suggest new topics to explore and retain writers.</li></ul><p>At the end of the study, I presented my results to the team (some screenshots below). </p><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/title.jpg" alt="title-slide"><div class="caption"></div></div><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/results.jpg" alt="results-slide"><div class="caption"></div></div><h2 class="project-header">Conclusion and Next Steps</h2><div class="project-content"><p class="project-p"><span>Subconscious is currently in the process of implementing these changes in the contributor process. 
We are also updating our website to reflect the new opportunities in the program.</span></p></div><div class="back-home">   <a class="btn" href="../../"><div class="label">Back to Projects</div></a></div></p></div></div></div><div class="break"></div><footer class="footer"><div class="super-container"><div class="footer-inner"> <div class="get-in-touch footer-section"><h3 class="footer-header header">Get in Touch</h3><p class="footer-p">Say hello at <a href="mailto:renoj@uconn.edu">renoj@uconn.edu</a></p><p class="weak">This site was proudly built in Pug, SASS, and Webpack</p></div><div class="footer-socials footer-section"><h3 class="footer-header header">Checkout More</h3><ul class="socials-list"><li class="socials-item"> <a class="socials-link" href="https://github.com/renojvarghese">GitHub</a></li><li class="socials-item"> <a class="socials-link" href="https://www.behance.net/renojvarghese">Behance</a></li><li class="socials-item"> <a class="socials-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/renoj-varghese/">LinkedIn</a></li></ul><a href="../../static/docs/resumeRenojVarghese.pdf">View Resume</a></div></div></div></footer><script type="text/javascript" src="../../main.js"></script></body></html>
